Program Flow:

define the grid size / calculate number of nodes

add nodes

connect with springs

create array to store calibration values

update:
	update kinect
	get depth values
	create custom indices based on grid spacing (store in array)
	get depth values using custom indices as the index for each

	set force strength based on distance from rest position
